#About content in Jekyll sites

The main types of content for Jekyll sites are pages and posts. A page is for standalone content that isn't associated with a specific date, such as an "About" page. The default Jekyll site contains a file called about.md, which renders as a page on your site at YOUR-SITE-URL/about. You can edit the contents of that file to personalize your "About" page, and you can use the "About" page as a template to create new pages. For more information, see "Pages" in the Jekyll documentation.
